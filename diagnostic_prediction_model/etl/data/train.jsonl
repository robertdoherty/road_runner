{"post_id": "reddit-1omt25n", "x_symptoms": "cracked heat exchanger; severe flame rollout; wires melting", "x_post": "Disabling a furnace that\u2019s \u201ccracked\u201d\n\nI ran an estimate yesterday for a young family that just bought a house and it was set up for A new heat pump estimate to replace the existing heat only gas furnace.\nSame shit as always, small talk, and building rapport find out what got them to take time out of their day to consider doing this blah blah blah \n\nWell, they had somebody out to do a tuneup since they just bought the house and told them they need to replace it. \nOpened up the closet, downflow furnace with the doors off, gas flex is gone, 110 V cord cut right at the furnace and taken, thermostat wires cut all the way back to the wall. \n\nIt\u2019s sort of a gray area, I encourage my technicians to give homeowners all of the information and make it clear that they recommend getting a new heat, exchanger or furnace at their earliest ability and make it clear on the paperwork that the homeowner is aware, but we don\u2019t shut people down. The state I live in only the local utility can condemn furnace \n\n15 years ago when I was the service tech, I used to see field technicians, turning off the gas flex and putting a little keychain with their company logo and number on it, and even that was sort of Shiesty to me.\n\nIn a lifetime of working on gas heaters, I could think of two times where I shut the gas off and that was only so I could take pictures of it off and then show the homeowner how to turn the gas flex back on and if they wanted to, that\u2019s on them, but I\u2019m leaving with it off . And that one, I wasn\u2019t even looking for a crack, there was such a severe flame rollout that wires were melting.\n\nOn a tuneup, I can remember a couple of times of finding such big cracks that if it had an inducer motor, it probably wouldn\u2019t pull vacuum enough to close it, but it was natural draft and still working. And obviously if it\u2019s cracked that bad, they\u2019ve been using it like that for a couple years at least .\nOne last stand out was a RHEEM with the tubular style chamber, where the little collection box whatever you call it was basically gone, but somehow the fucker would still run. That one I turned off and didn\u2019t even really tell them it was on them. If they wanted to turn it back on, I made it very clear this furnace should absolutely not be turned on.\n\nBut taking the ability away, like leaving with the flex, the 110 and cutting the thermostat wires all the way back to the wall on A downflow BDP that has the typical little hairline fracture behind the high limit where everybody sticks their finger in to see if they can feel one \u2026. That\u2019s wild as shit to me.\n\nIn other municipalities or states, I believe that A certified gas or hvac technician can legally red tag, certainly not where I live, but I\u2019ve always been curious. What is the standard operating procedure in other areas.\n\nI live in an area where if you didn\u2019t have a heater or an air conditioner, you\u2019re gonna be OK you\u2019re around, but I can imagine in colder areas.

{"post_id": "reddit-1olbwss", "x_symptoms": "furnace not turning up to second stage; second pressure switch clicking on/off; gas valve clicking on/off; flames widening and narrowing; pressure switch not staying closed; draft bouncing around -.43 to -.55 \"wc; draft dipping to -.13\"", "x_post": "Need help understanding where to take high efficiency draft measurements, and a possibly explanation to the issue I faced yesterday.\n\nSorry for the long explanation, but I'm going to try and describe every detail of this weird symptom. I'm a service tech in training (apprentice level experience) and yesterday I was working with another tech who is not a trainer.  My team lead is assigning me to ride along with different techs to see what they do before I get my own van. I do not like working with this guy because he's constantly cutting corners, typically does not perform basic maintenance, and just wants to move on to the next call to try and find a cracked heat exchanger. I will have my own truck soon and I won't have to put up with him for much longer, but I'm coming to Reddit to try and understand this better.\n\nWe were doing a routine service+cleaning, and we had a Carrier 2 stage 100k BTU high efficiency furnace and it wouldn't turn up to second stage. The second pressure switch that controls voltage to the second stage of the gas valve would click for a second, then click off. The gas valve would click, then click off after a second. The flames would widen and narrow, widen and narrow, over and over. The pressure switch that sends 24v to the gas valve just wouldn't stay closed. It had 24v to the switch, and had no problem sending 24v to the valve, but the switch would not stay closed. When this started happening, the tech took over. I did not think to check the pressure switch rating, and I wish I could provide that detail. Draft was always bouncing around -.43 to -.55 \"WC, and we were measuring the intake side. I don't recall the inducer changing speed or sound so I don't know what it was doing. Occasionally draft would dip really low to -.13\" for a split second but the furnace would stay running. We cleaned all of the water components like the collector box, inducer motor, Exhaust boot and collector trap TWICE. \n\nThe tech got frustrated and kind of gave up, but he just kept looking at draft and waited. On our third or fourth startup waiting for second stage, It seemed to magically kick over to second stage and stay there. After less than a minute on second stage, he called it good and we left, despite not understanding what changed for it to work properly. We did not check gas pressures. He would not take my suggestion to look at the exhaust flue to try and find a clog (we had the door off the entire time so intake is out of the equation, AND he had a 2\" coupler on his truck. We could have made one cut, checked the entire length of the exhaust flue, and glued it back together in 5 minutes. We could have used a long inspection camera to look around a 45 degree bend or two). The longest 7ft part of the flue was level and didn't have slope. We did not confirm 120v at the inducer or check resistance of the inducer motor coils for a short to ground or high resistance. We did not measure amp draw of the inducer while it was running.\n\nQuestions: \n\nCan a weak inducer cause that issue? If the control board kicks up inducer speed for second stage, but the inducer is weak enough to spin at just the right speed to be right at the rating of the pressure switch, would this cause the symptom?\n\nHow do pressure switches typically fail? Electrically or mechanically? I know how to test them with a manometer and test continuity, but a lot of guys on my team complain about the dreaded three light pressure switch code. I'm quickly learning that a lot of them don't know what to check once they have that code, but the pressure switch tests good.\n\nLooking back, I don't think that this is a flue issue despite not being allowed to open the flue. If there was a blockage, we would have too HIGH of a pressure on the intake side right? Blockage means less airflow and higher pressure/less draft as a result. Right?\n\nWhen would you take a \"WC measurement on the exhaust side of the inducer?\n\nThanks for reading this clusterfuck of a post and helping me understand this issue.", "equip": {"system_type": "", "subtype": "", "brand": "carrier", "model_family_id": "", "model_text": ""}, "y_diag": [["dx.sensor_or_safety_fault", 0.6]], "provenance": "llm_v1", "rule_label": "dx.other_or_unclear", "rule_confidence": 0.2, "rule_fired_rules": [], "reddit_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HVAC/comments/1olbwss/need_help_understanding_where_to_take_high/", "subreddit": "HVAC", "symptoms_canon": ["furnace_not_turning_up_to_second_stage", "second_pressure_switch_clicking_on_off", "gas_valve_clicking_on_off", "flames_widening_and_narrowing", "pressure_switch_not_staying_closed", "draft_bouncing_around_-.43_to_-.55_\"wc", "draft_dipping_to_-.13\""], "split": "train"}

The gas valve is now in second stage but it seems like the inducer motor is stuck in first stage I did check the port that's plugged into the board when I checked common to first stage I was getting 120 volts but when I checked common to second stage I was getting some weird voltage I was getting 210 volts which I thought was weird it was pretty late at this point I just went ahead and called it and said I was going to go ahead and order the inducer motor and the control board but just for future reference do you guys believe it was the inducer motor or the control board that was the issue The furnace kept running when I was there eventually it would kick itself out I believe it's because of the gas valve is feeding too much and the inducer didn't switch over to the second stage which is overfeeding too much gas causing the pressure switch drop out anybody else run into this issue before?\n\nRheem \nModel number - RGPE-07EAMKR", "equip": {"system_type": "", "subtype": "", "brand": "rheem", "model_family_id": "", "model_text": ""}, "y_diag": [["dx.controls_board_or_comm", 0.6]], "provenance": "llm_v1", "rule_label": "dx.other_or_unclear", "rule_confidence": 0.2, "rule_fired_rules": [], "reddit_url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ojje1r", "subreddit": "HVAC", "symptoms_canon": ["no_heat", "pressure_switch_fault", "inducer_motor_not_increasing_speed_in_second_stage", "gas_valve_overfeeding_gas"], "split": "train"}

Gauges don't move when this happens.  Daikin suggested rotation of the tap point by 30 degrees.  We've also replaced the flow switch thinking it might be bad.  Running out of ideas here.
