Half of the house is open to the main ceiling/roof, while the other half has a second floor that overlooks the 2 story part with 2 bd / 1 bath, although the upstairs bdrm ceilings are open to the main ceiling/roof.  I'm running a single zone 33kbtu mini-split, that's mounted about 14' above the first floor.\nThe problem is that I'm getting a fairly extreme difference in temp between floors. I have the mini-split louvers pointed as far down as they go to push the hot air down into the 2-story space, and have two low-mid speed ceiling fans on the ceiling/roof blowing down that run 24/7 to churn the air. Still, I'm seeing the upstairs typically 3-4 degrees (F) hotter than the first floor; worse when its cold - sometimes as much as 8 degrees so far (winter is just starting). The upstairs temp matches the mini-split set temp, as it's at 14', so it gets cold on the main floor, which makes me irritable. LOL. There are a lot of windows, none of which have curtains, so adding curtains will likely help.\nI'm thinking I need bigger and/or faster fans at least, but hoping somebody has suggestion that I haven't thought of.

He swapped the board after tinkering for a bit. Same issue. \n\nI swung by this evening and Same thing. Will occasionally run, but drop out, sometimes won't light at all. Found the spark ignition wire was visibly arcing across other wires it was bundled with randomly despite no breaks in wires. Separated them, all good there now but same intermittent firing.

{"post_id": "reddit-1olbwss", "x_symptoms": "furnace not reaching second stage; pressure switch cycling clicking on/off; gas valve cycling clicking on/off; flames widening and narrowing", "x_post": "Need help understanding where to take high efficiency draft measurements, and a possibly explanation to the issue I faced yesterday.\n\nSorry for the long explanation, but I'm going to try and describe every detail of this weird symptom. I'm a service tech in training (apprentice level experience) and yesterday I was working with another tech who is not a trainer.  My team lead is assigning me to ride along with different techs to see what they do before I get my own van. I do not like working with this guy because he's constantly cutting corners, typically does not perform basic maintenance, and just wants to move on to the next call to try and find a cracked heat exchanger. I will have my own truck soon and I won't have to put up with him for much longer, but I'm coming to Reddit to try and understand this better.\n\nWe were doing a routine service+cleaning, and we had a Carrier 2 stage 100k BTU high efficiency furnace and it wouldn't turn up to second stage. The second pressure switch that controls voltage to the second stage of the gas valve would click for a second, then click off. The gas valve would click, then click off after a second. The flames would widen and narrow, widen and narrow, over and over. The pressure switch that sends 24v to the gas valve just wouldn't stay closed. It had 24v to the switch, and had no problem sending 24v to the valve, but the switch would not stay closed. When this started happening, the tech took over. I did not think to check the pressure switch rating, and I wish I could provide that detail. Draft was always bouncing around -.43 to -.55 \"WC, and we were measuring the intake side. I don't recall the inducer changing speed or sound so I don't know what it was doing. Occasionally draft would dip really low to -.13\" for a split second but the furnace would stay running. We cleaned all of the water components like the collector box, inducer motor, Exhaust boot and collector trap TWICE. \n\nThe tech got frustrated and kind of gave up, but he just kept looking at draft and waited. On our third or fourth startup waiting for second stage, It seemed to magically kick over to second stage and stay there. After less than a minute on second stage, he called it good and we left, despite not understanding what changed for it to work properly. We did not check gas pressures. He would not take my suggestion to look at the exhaust flue to try and find a clog (we had the door off the entire time so intake is out of the equation, AND he had a 2\" coupler on his truck. We could have made one cut, checked the entire length of the exhaust flue, and glued it back together in 5 minutes. We could have used a long inspection camera to look around a 45 degree bend or two). The longest 7ft part of the flue was level and didn't have slope. We did not confirm 120v at the inducer or check resistance of the inducer motor coils for a short to ground or high resistance. We did not measure amp draw of the inducer while it was running.\n\nQuestions: \n\nCan a weak inducer cause that issue? If the control board kicks up inducer speed for second stage, but the inducer is weak enough to spin at just the right speed to be right at the rating of the pressure switch, would this cause the symptom?\n\nHow do pressure switches typically fail? Electrically or mechanically? I know how to test them with a manometer and test continuity, but a lot of guys on my team complain about the dreaded three light pressure switch code. I'm quickly learning that a lot of them don't know what to check once they have that code, but the pressure switch tests good.\n\nLooking back, I don't think that this is a flue issue despite not being allowed to open the flue. If there was a blockage, we would have too HIGH of a pressure on the intake side right? Blockage means less airflow and higher pressure/less draft as a result. Right?\n\nWhen would you take a \"WC measurement on the exhaust side of the inducer?\n\nThanks for reading this clusterfuck of a post and helping me understand this issue.", "equip": {"system_type": "residential_furnace", "subtype": "", "brand": "carrier", "model_family_id": "carrier.unknown_furnace", "model_text": ""}, "y_diag": [["dx.furnace_pressure_switch_failed_or_tubing_blocked", 0.6]], "provenance": "llm_v1", "rule_label": "dx.other_or_unclear", "rule_confidence": 0.2, "rule_fired_rules": [], "reddit_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HVAC/comments/1olbwss/need_help_understanding_where_to_take_high/", "subreddit": "HVAC", "symptoms_canon": ["furnace_not_reaching_second_stage", "pressure_switch_cycling_clicking_on_off", "gas_valve_cycling_clicking_on_off", "flames_widening_and_narrowing"], "split": "train"}

{"post_id": "reddit-1ofre9c", "x_symptoms": "no heat; furnace immediately trips; terrible temperature imbalance", "x_post": "Sizing on new installs\n\nIt's long, but please read if you have time because i need some advice.\n\nRecently i had a negative experience with a customer. Went to a house for a no heat call, early 2000s 70k btu A cabinet 90+ in a 1300ish sqft house, flames shooting out, tried to adjust things but it was clear it was a replacement scenario. The supply plenum was just a 14x20x36 box with 3 six inch runs coming off it. Only 3 thats it. Return was better, filter boot with 8x20 going up and to multiple large floor grilles.\n\nAnyways, I quote the customer a new 60k 90+ while explaining several times about the undersized ductwork. It is a low income area, house is a mess, customer only has the money for the swap out and nothing more. I tried my best to explain why i wasn't going to put a 40k in because of the size and the needs of the house, and that the 60k may not run and we may need to open some of the plenum after install to have heat in the house. Customer says they understand and agree.\n\nFast forward to turn on, yes it immediately trips so I cut out an 8x20 hole on the back of the plenum, put a temporary 8x20 grille over it, and give them a VERY cheap quote to add an plenum 8x20 plenum through a specific route, with 7-8 runs off it throughout the house. Maybe someday they say. Ok fine.\n\nAfter a few days they complain about the terrible temperature imbalance between different areas of the house so I give them a few options good better best and they said they have no money and also magically have no recollection of our conversation about their undersized ductwork and everything and said the old furnace worked way better than the new one. I feel this is turning into a possible bad reputation deal for me, so I go over there, donate a few hours and two 10\" flex ducts and give them quite a bit more distribution and balance than they had before. Very far from ideal, but the issue is more or less solved and they didn't have to pay anything for the additional work, so they are a satisfied customer now.\n\nGetting to the point, I have two questions:\n\n1. When ductwork is clearly undersized, why do old furnaces work for so long and new furnaces do not, which components are different? The old furnace had a high limit, it had rollouts, what is the deal?\n\n2. It's always a stressful thing for me to size a new unit for a customer and have to decide between the size of the house and the capacity of the ductwork while trying to keep my price competitive and not trying to scare the customer to potential extra ductwork costs that i know some other guys aren't going to bother with. Do you guys have any advice for preventing conflict and misunderstanding? It is a lot to explain every time im in this scenario, and i know the more i talk the less they absorb.\n\n\n\nLast thing, i have another job I'm bidding on now with a 120k 90+ and only an 8x24 duct as the supply plenum. It has been working for years like that, and the other guys are just quoting a swap, but i know it could use more than just a swap. So this is yet another similar situation for me.

I\u2019m an HVAC tech but I\u2019ve always worked on the commercial/industrial side so this isn\u2019t an issue I\u2019ve run into before. Not a lot of 97% furnaces in my world. End of last winter my buddy\u2019s furnace tripped the roll out switch a few random times. I didn\u2019t see it roll out but the flames are visibly lazy. Initially when I looked at it my combustion analyzer was out for repairs so I did the basics, verified draft and gas pressure, air flow, checked supply air for CO, etc. Spring came and it was kinda forgotten about. Now that winter is back I went for a better look. Went through the A coil with a camera to look at the HX. I found a few rings from the clamshell laying on the secondary HX but didn\u2019t find any visible cracks. I\u2019m reading really high CO levels <1500 ppm and high oxygen levels with my analyzer. I still have good readings on the draft fan and the temperature split is good. It pulls its combustion air from the space and I made sure the exhaust was clear. I was thinking there is cracks and the draft fan is drawing through them but that should be a rather large crack to bring enough oxygen in to cool the flame and raise CO levels.

{"post_id": "reddit-1nrwl7q", "x_symptoms": "completely charred the inside of the furnace", "x_post": "Hang in there fellas, it gets better\n\nI\u2019ve walked a really odd path in this trade. I started out in commercial at an amazing company. I stayed there for over 2 years but felt like I was never going to progress if I was just a filter and belt changer. I watched my buddies in residential be promoted to service technicians after 2 years in maintenance and got a bit jealous. I left my nice cushy company to go to another commercial company for $1 more per hour. Bad move. They fired my mom my first day in the field. I finished up the call that I was on and turned in the keys to my van. I was there for 4 days. Finding another job in HVAC with my experience level was extremely difficult. I had just moved out of my parents and in with my fiance at the time that I quit that job. It took 3 months of rigorously applying to all sorts of different positions. I even tried to become a cook at Chili\u2019s and Applebee\u2019s just to have some sort of income and end the constant fighting between myself and my future wife. I got into resi after 3 months of applying that was seemingly never going to end. Resi wasn\u2019t bad but the company I work for is one of those PE companies that we talk so much about. They wanted me selling the top option to each customer. I\u2019m a terrible salesman and on top of mistakes that I\u2019ve made on calls (being new to actually maintaining units, not just changing filters and belts) a few days before Christmas 2024 I left the gas plug out of a furnace after taking a gas pressure reading and it completely charred the inside of the furnace. My manager told me to sit at home for a few days while he figured out what to do with me. I ended up getting written up and almost fired. They told me I could join their duct cleaning team or \u201cpart ways as friends\u201d. Man I was completely defeated. I still needed a job so I accepted. I got as good as I possibly could at duct cleanings and got revenue flowing on the duct cleaning side. Only ethical selling\u2014 completely necessary repairs. My manager keeps asking me to go back into maintenance now and I won\u2019t accept. No way will I be playing their reindeer games again. For nearly the past year of being a duct cleaner I\u2019ve been upping my knowledge within the trade and I\u2019m really impressed by the amount of growth I\u2019ve been able to achieve just by pushing myself harder and more consistently. Now I\u2019ve got job offers like this one that nearly made me tear up after all the hard times I\u2019ve seen in this trade. My current crap employer pays me $18/ hour and doesn\u2019t respect my time or knowledge/ experience. Big mistake. I\u2019m way more comfortable with HVAC equipment now and I\u2019m going to make one of my future employers happy to have me. Rant over. Sorry for the word vomit. This trade means a lot to me and I take pride in my work. This job offer that I just received a few days ago makes all the hard times worth it.\n\nTLDR: not every employer is going to treat you like dirt. Take your career into your own hands and push yourself when you\u2019re at home, instead of scrolling Facebook take the time to learn something new in your field. It pays off MASSIVELY. Almost a $10/ pay raise from where I\u2019m at and a bump in title. Not even union.
