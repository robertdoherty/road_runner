I've replaced this entire common flue venting for all the appliances in the mech room. They all share 5\" B vent. From top to bottom, 75k water tank, 75k 80% Rheem, 90k 80% Carrier.\n\nInital issue, weak draft on water tank and Rheem. Found a couple dead birds, and fistfulls of rust within the horizontal sections. Furnaces have been replaced but the flue was reused. Carrier furnace on my first visit was good, -.04wc. Rheem and water tank shared negligible drafts, damn near neutral or -.01 at their deepest. I didnt check the entire stack for draft. \n\nAfter replacing everything, all drafts were WORSE than when I started. Water tank and rheem still neutral, but even the Carrier went to 0. I restarted my analyzer 3 times, and earlier today on a check up it was just fine. The common vent draft when everything was firing was -.06wc. With the water tank not firing, furnaces were still neutral, and stack draft was -.03wc.
