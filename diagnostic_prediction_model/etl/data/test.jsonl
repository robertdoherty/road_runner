So I pull the disconnect, rinse it out, plug it back in, all is good. I go inside to turn the unit on as always because I won't leave a house until I see it run one last time. \"ERROR 179, Outdoor communication fault.\" Fuck. \n\nSo I go through my procedure. Got my DC so it's communicating everywhere, airhandler runs, condenser does not. I've got low voltage everywhere except where my 24 from the outside board feeds the contactor. Ohm it out, boards fried. And now all the supply houses are closed, the only one that would even have it doesn't have it. Can't get it til tomorrow after lunch. So basically I went over to this elderly couples house, for a bullshit PM on a 5 year old unit and the freakin board shits the bed as I'm there...so it's my fault. Honest to god, I didn't do anything out of the ordinary, didn't touch anything I shouldn't have, hell I never even opened the outdoor panel cause this unit has nothing in there worth checking if the unit is running properly. So now these folks have no air and there's absolutely nothin I can do about it cause the supply houses are closed. What would you do? Call it fluke and make the homeowner pay for it because you know beyond the shadow of a doubt you did nothing to cause it? I say that honestly.  I'd own it if i fucked up as I always do. \n\nOr do you pay out of pocket and hook them up cause all fingers are pointing at me since it was working, I messed with it, and now it doesn't? \n\nI'll tell ya what I did though, I wired the fan and the compressor straight to the contactor and stole 24V straight off the outdoor transformer and changed a few settings to let them have air. Thank god for relays. So technically they have air, just not fancy air.\n\nPersonally I'm not gonna make them pay for it, cause there is no way to prove to them I didn't cause it, even though I know it had nothing to do with me. My thought is it was about to fail soon anyway and as soon as I dumped 244V on it after washing it the camels back broke...ironically as I'm standing there...complete fluke.\n\nAnyway, thats the shitty ending to my day. Nothin else I can do about it but fix them up tomorrow. Just sucks.

The unit has a pre-heat water coil, Refrigerant coil, then a re- heat coil.
